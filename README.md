In 2014, City Council passed Local Law 97, requiring buildings over 25,000 square feet to cut their emissions gradually to zero emissions by 2050. This is a necessary step for the broader commitment to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, since buildings contribute to 71% of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions. 
<br>
<br>
Local Law 97 issued emission caps for each building calculated based on its type (office, multifamily housing, restaurant, etc.) and square footage, with decreasing limits across each of its five enforcement phases. The phases last from 2024-2029, 2030-2034, 2035-2039, 2040=2049, and 2050, and from 2050 onwards, any emissions will be penalized and fined.
<br>
<br>
To help buildings prepare for this change, City Council also passed Local Law 84, which requires each building to report on their energy and water consumption based on their utility bills, and gives them a score, similar to food health and safety ratings. This way, buildings are aware if they will be impacted Local Law 97, and how far they have to go to reduce emissions below the allowable amount.

Due to limitations in GeoJson, this map focuses on the West Village, but using this same codebase and methodology, you should be able to create a similar maps for your desired neighborhoods.
