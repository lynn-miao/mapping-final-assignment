                Buildings in New York are the largest source of greenhouse gas, contributing 71% of total emissions and
                94% of electricity consumption. In order for the city to achieve its goal of reducing emissions by 80%
                by 2050, it must tackle its infrastructure.</p>
                <p>To tackle this problem, City Council passed Local Law 97, which will begin issuing fines in 2024.
                    Buildings larger than 25,000 sq. ft. will be required to reduce their emissions or face increasing
                    penalties. </p>
                <p>Penalties are determined by the emissions amount and type, and emissions limit will decrease over
                    five phases to zero by 2050. </p>

                    Methodology
                </div>
                <br />
                <div class="answer" id="answer1">Emissions are measured using a building’s gas, fuel, and electricity
                    consumption, and limits are calculated by square footage and property usage type. <p>To calculate
                        each building's estimated penalties, I used emissions and benchmarking data from mandated by
                        Local Law 84, that requires buildings to report on their energy and water usage using national
                        standards for reporting, in this case through the EPA's online tool "Energy Star Portfolio
                        Manager."
                    <p>I downloaded the data from NYC Open Data, calculated the emissions limits based on property type
                        and square footage in Excel for buildings greater than 25,000 square feet, compared the limit to
                        the permitted amount by property type and square footage, and then calculated the penalties
                        based on the amount of excess emissions. Then I used QGIS and PLUTO to join the penalty and
                        emissions data aginst City parcels, exported the file into GeoJson, and created this map! This map is solely focused on the West Village, but using this same methodology and code, you can recreate this map for other neighborhoods.
